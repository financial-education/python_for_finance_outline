#+title: Python for Finance
#+SETUPFILE: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/org/theme-readtheorg.setup
#+OPTIONS: num:nil

The course is broadly divided into 4 modules, each with 3 to 4 sessions. There are also 2 bonus sessions.

- Be sure to follow along in your copy of the Colab Notebooks.
- You can always go back to the original Colab Notebooks using the links below.  So don't hesitate to modify your copy---you learn best by experimenting. 

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Note most other courses use stock data and create trading algorithms.  Here we are going to focus on core financial analyst tasks, e.g. what is the average PPP loan size in Texas? These questions are increasingly being answered in Python rather than Excel.

We can provide exercises at the end of each session.  The students can complete these in a Jupyter notebook, and we can provide solutions.  Do we want to attempt to grade them?

** Session 6

[[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TWjqlgTp1Fyyy_ykp48LBVFWjRqtBwzo][Colab Notebook]]

The previous sections have used data available online through APIs and flat files.  Commonly the financial analyst will have to query relational (SQL) databases.  In this section we'll cover the basics of connecting to a SQL database in Python, and executing SQL queries, and returning the data as a Pandas /DataFrame/.
